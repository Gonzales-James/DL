The function that performs forward propagation is also utilized in this function. Inside this function, we firstly initialized the output of the final layer from the forward propagation function. After it was initialized, it was then used to compute for the error signal which the formula is given from the problem set, and also the learning rate is initialized to 0.25. To compute the weights for each layer, initialized weights are subtracted by the product of learning rate and the delta, then it was multiplied by the output of each layer of forward propagation.  The process was repeated until the last weights were computed. Backpropagation is the process of moving from the output to the input layer, this outputs weights that will be used to calculate the error to know if the results are already optimized or not."
